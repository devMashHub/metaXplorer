# metaXplorer
metaXplorer is a project I've wanted to tinker with for a long time, but it is probably a pointless
mess to everyone else on the planet.

Right now, I am learning electron, webpack, html/css/javascript, and vue.js; so the only thing this
project does is run with some splitters and a prototype treeview.

I will explain my project goals more clearly when the codebase becomes more sophisticated.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/devMashHub/metaXplorer.git
$ cd metaXplorer
```
Install dependencies using NPM
```
$ npm install
```
Transpile with Webpack
```
$ npm run wbp
```
Run with electron
```
$ electron-forge start
```
